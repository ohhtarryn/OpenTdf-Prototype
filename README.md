This project is a prototype for me to practice coding. It is built on an idea that I have, but built at the smallest level I can build it.

The smallest level had 3 users types.
Person A - The admin (me)
Person 1 - One of the people in a couple
Person 2 - The other person in a couple

There is a dashboard for each user.

Person A sends a question to Person 1 and Person 2. Person 1 and Person 2 each answer the question seperately. 
Their answers are wrapped in TDF and access is given to person A. Access can be revoked by either users at any time.

Once Person A has both answers, they will generate a discussion question based on the differences in the answers
Then the couple will be able to talk about that question and understand each other better.
